* WARNING: BouncingShape::Segment does not support serialization. Returning nil.
Please override the :serialize method and return a hash so that
Class can be persisted to disk in the event of an exception.
Here is an example of what you need to do:
#+begin_src ruby
class BouncingShape::Segment
  # 1. Create a serialize method that returns a hash with all of
  #    the values you care about.
  def serialize
    { }
  end

  # 2. Override the inspect method and return ~serialize.to_s~.
  def inspect
    serialize.to_s
  end

  # 3. Override to_s and return ~serialize.to_s~.
  def to_s
    serialize.to_s
  end
end
#+end_src
